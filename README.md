# RedBee - React Style Guide

## Install

Add `@redbee/react-design-system` in your `package.json` file as a dependency:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@redbee/react-design-system": "git://github.com/redbeestudios/react-design-system.git"
  }
}
```

Then run `yarn` or `npm install` to install.

We currently don't publish `react-design-system` so you will be importing the sources directly from github and transpiling them with an automatic `postinstall` script.
